It's done! Parallelism was an idea I mocked up a few months ago but, due to other
committments, didn't get around to putting to code until recently. Different to
my more general-purpose freebies, this one's specifically built for portfolio use
with a very unique look/layout. Hope you enjoy it!

Demo images* are courtesy of the supremely talented photographer Felicia Simion.
If you like photography or just enjoy being blown away by awesome stuff, check
out her portfolio for more stunning images:

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
